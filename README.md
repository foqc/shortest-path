# Finding the shortest path
There is a list of words and that given the word of beginning and end the shortest path must be found, starting from the beginning to the end, the only 2 rules are.

- Only one letter can be changed at the same time

- The intermediate words that are generated must exist in the word list.

This is an implementation of the Breadth First Search to find the shortest path.
